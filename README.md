The Crystal Game!

The project is a useful way to learn different web development techniques while also creating a fun game for people to play. Simply download the code and start playing the game! The goal is to beat the computer and use the crystals to hit the target! If you would like help with the project please contact me through github. I am currently the sole maintainer of this code but anyone is able to contribute!
